📝 Comment Resolution Report

Original Comment: Resolve TODO 046: Enforce HTTPS in exchange BaseURLs (Binance, etc.). File: `market_maker/internal/exchange/binance/binance.go` (and others). Add runtime validation in `New...Exchange` functions.

Changes Made:
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/binance/binance.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement logic and allowed `http://` for localhost/127.0.0.1 (for testing).
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/binancespot/binance_spot.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement and added localhost exception.
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/bitget/bitget.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement and added localhost exception.
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/bybit/bybit.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement and added localhost exception.
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/gate/gate.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement and added localhost exception.
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/okx/okx.go`: Verified HTTPS enforcement and added localhost exception.
- `market_maker/internal/exchange/factory.go`: Updated `NewExchange` to handle the error returned by `New...Exchange` functions (fixing a compilation error).
- Updated all unit tests in `market_maker/internal/exchange/` to handle the new error return value from exchange constructors.

Resolution Summary:
The `New...Exchange` functions now strictly enforce that the `BaseURL` (if provided) starts with `https://`, unless the host is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` (to support local testing). This prevents accidental use of insecure connections in production. I also fixed the `factory.go` implementation and all related unit tests which were previously broken due to unhandled error returns from the updated constructors. All exchange tests are now passing.

✅ Status: Resolved
