📝 Comment Resolution Report

Original Comment: Resolve TODO 044: Add Prometheus/OTel counters for regime changes in `RegimeMonitor`.

Changes Made:
- `market_maker/internal/trading/monitor/regime.go`: Imported telemetry package and added `RegimeChanges` metric incrementation in `handleKlineUpdate` and `UpdateFromIndicators` methods.

Resolution Summary:
Added instrumentation to track market regime changes. The `market_maker_regime_changes_total` counter is now incremented whenever the regime transitions (e.g., from RANGE to BULL_TREND).
- Included attributes: `symbol`, `old_regime`, `new_regime`, and `trigger` (either "kline_update" or "manual_update").
- Added nil checks for the metrics holder to ensure tests running without full telemetry initialization do not panic.

✅ Status: Resolved
